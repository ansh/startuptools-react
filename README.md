# startuptools-react

All credit for this idea goes to Trevor Blackwell who created the original version [here](http://growth.tlb.org/). He (I believe) originally got the idea for this concept from Paul Graham's essay ["Default Alive or Default Dead"](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html). 

Here's an excerpt from Trevor's original website:
> This tool calculates how much funding your startup needs. Assuming your expenses are constant and your revenue is growing, it shows when you'll reach profitability and how much capital you'll burn through before then. Once you're profitable, you control your destiny: you can raise more to grow faster if you want.
> 
> You can drag the red or green handles to set expense, revenue and growth. Geometrically, the capital needed is the blue-shaded area between the revenue and expense curves.
> 
> If you raised exactly the amount calculated and everything goes as expected, your bank account would be at $0 the month you hit profitability, which is kind of stressful. So raise a comfortable margin above it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
